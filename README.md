## üöÄ What is Code Stats?

**Code Stats** is a blazing-fast CLI tool to analyze your codebase and get instant statistics:

- File counts, line counts, comment lines, and empty lines
- Per-extension breakdown (e.g., `.go`, `.js`, `.ts`, ...)
- Ignore directories and filter by file extension
- Export results as CSV, JSON, or a beautiful HTML report
- Modern, responsive HTML output for sharing or archiving

Whether you're curious about your project's size, want to track documentation coverage, or need a quick report for your team, Code Stats has you covered!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repo and build with Go (requires Go 1.21+):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-stats.git
cd code-stats
go build -o code-stats
```

Or run directly:

```sh
go run main.go [options]
```

---

## ‚ö° Usage

Analyze the current directory:

```sh
./code-stats
```

Analyze a specific directory, only `.go` and `.js` files, ignoring `node_modules`:

```sh
./code-stats -e go,js -i node_modules
```

Show progress for each file:

```sh
./code-stats --progress
```

Export as CSV, JSON, or HTML:

```sh
./code-stats --csv -o stats.csv
./code-stats --json -o stats.json
./code-stats --html -o stats.html
```

Suppress all console output (for CI):

```sh
./code-stats --json -o stats.json --verbose
```
